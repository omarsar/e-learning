### Can e-learning replace classroom learning?
Hypothesis: emphasizing on learner-centered activity and system interactivity allows remote learners to outperform traditional classroom students.
- Make it about the learning experience of the students

Notes from Abstract:
- Time and effectiveness of learning very important
- Personalization, flexibility, portability, and on demand also essential for learning

The study aims to explore the new multimedia technologies and their effectiveness on learning.
- Importance of how knowledge is delivered or distributed.

On e-learning for training industry employees
- They must also be included in the targeting of online learning content created for masses.

MIT made their material available
- Discussion: The approach they made to make it available is not the most effective approach as content was delivered in its raw state.
- A good opportunity to create mini learning courses from such raw content

The difference between elearning and the conventional classroom learning
- In online learning the course is built around the learner (e.g., self-paced learning)
- In the conventional classroom the instructors have control over the learning process
- The learning process is the main factor of debate here, but this doesn't include the obvious benefits of group discussion and interaction with different cultures
    - Discussion: What are the benefits of group discussion, which is the main advatage of traditional face-to-face classrooms
- From Table 1 the point that mainly standsout, in my point of view, is motivation. This is where e-learning fails to be effective.
    - Discussion: What can be done in terms of system improvement (e.g., interactivity and engagement) that keep learners motivated.
        - Better grading systems
        - Competitiveness through ranking systems; leatherboards (related to gamification)
        - Research other areas where effective tools and techniques are used to retain users;
            - It has to have some relation with learning as not the same brain regions may be involved in these activities
        - Are there certain mechanisms which uses big data that can trigger our reward system
            - Fun surveys and quizes that generate personalized analysis and interesting facts

In an e-learning environment student may get frustrated, feel confused, or loose interest because of the inadequacy of these learning systems:
- E.g., the use of only text-based material;
    - Discussion: How can this be improved in terms of interactivity? What other factors impact students negatively besides lack of interactivity and interest?
        - Studies can be conducted on social media that deal with the sentiment analysis of users and what their are complaining about.
            - E.g., the use of jargon; long paragraphs etc.
    - Improvement can be offer interactive tools, such as "comment everywhere" systems.
    - What can be done to improve good understanding of text-based learning resources? Graphs? Illustrations?
    - How can we mimic the real conversations that occur in traditional classrooms?
- The use of sound, text, image, and video affect learner-content interactivity and may negatively affect learning, especially when presenting instructional content.
    - Discussion: How about improving knowledge structure through concept graphs
    - Discussion: How to improve the overall learning process; What is the learning process like?
    - In the paper, hints of immediate question and answering systems are highlighted and proposed, specifically as it relates to instructional videos
        - This is observed as a disadvantage when compared to conventional classroom environments in which question can be addressed immediately.
    - Pay close attention to the problem of "passive" learning vs "active" learning

Discussion: How to effectively synthesize multimedia content?
  - To answer this question we need to understand the impact of different factors as it relates to e-learning effectiveness
      - Some factors may be discovered using big data analytics on forumns where dialogue occurs

Factors on which the proposed system focuses:
- Multimedia integration
- Immediate knowledge acquition
- Interactivity (e.g., real-time Q/A)
- Self-directivity - personalized, self-paced learning
- Flexibility and Intelligence (track learning patterns and progress, then provides personalized lecturing)      

Constructive Learning Theory suggests that everyone has their own learning patterns or prefer to learn in their own way.

The Learning By Asking (LBA) system allows learners to ask questions to other learners via well-composed questions or through simple keywords
- An assistant built into the LBA is also able to answer questions and provide quick guides and suggestions based on user history
- The LBA system provide all sort of controls for user to manuevur around the system easily, offering the necessary flexibility required by learners.
- The LBA system also provide the traditional commenting features
- Discussion: How can chat or conversational bots be used to improve such systems.

Based on the experiments conducted:
- Students in the e-learning setting performed far better than the students in the traditional classroom environment
- The level of satisfaction wasn't significant
- Through questionairres, student reported that they enjoyed the self-paced learning

Discussion: Perhaps we can learn from e-learning environments to improve traditional classrooms learning as well.
- For instance, observe how students ask questions; are there any patterns as to the time the questions are asked? and what kind of question are asked; and when.

E-learning requires more maturiy and self-discipline
- What can be done about this fact in order to improve the learning experience for different type of students?
- What can be done to improve motivation?
- What can be done to lower the high number of dropouts?
- What can be done about the logistical concerns?

Other issues to pay attention to in the e-learning environment:
- Trust, Authorization, Confidentiality, Responsibility
- Security
- The need for high-bandwith access

E-elearning can also be seen as a compliment to tranditional classroom learning instead of a complete replacement.
- This can be done by integrating appropriate pedagogical methods to interactive systems.
