### [Can e-learning replace classroom learning?](http://courses.christopherylam.com/5180/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/zhang2004.pdf)

Hypothesis: emphasizing on learner-centered activity and system interactivity allows remote learners to outperform traditional classroom students.
- Make it about the learning experience of the students

Notes from Abstract:
- Time and effectiveness of learning very important
- Personalization, flexibility, portability, and on demand also essential for learning

The study aims to explore the new multimedia technologies and their effectiveness on learning.
- Importance of how knowledge is delivered or distributed.

On e-learning for training industry employees
- They must also be included in the targeting of online learning content created for masses.

MIT made their material available
- Discussion: The approach they made to make it available is not the most effective approach as content was delivered in its raw state.
- A good opportunity to create mini learning courses from such raw content

The difference between e-learning and the conventional classroom learning
- In online learning the course is built around the learner (e.g., self-paced learning)
- In the conventional classroom the instructors have control over the learning process
- The learning process is the main factor of debate here, but this doesn't include the obvious benefits of group discussion and interaction with different cultures
    - Discussion: What are the benefits of group discussion, which is the main advantage of traditional face-to-face classrooms
- From Table 1 the point that mainly stands out, in my point of view, is motivation. This is where e-learning fails to be effective.
    - Discussion: What can be done in terms of system improvement (e.g., interactivity and engagement) that keep learners motivated.
        - Better grading systems
        - Competitiveness through ranking systems; leaderboards (related to gamification)
        - Research other areas where effective tools and techniques are used to retain users;
            - It has to have some relation with learning as not the same brain regions may be involved in these activities
        - Are there certain mechanisms which uses big data that can trigger our reward system
            - Fun surveys and quizzes that generate personalized analysis and interesting facts

In an e-learning environment student may get frustrated, feel confused, or loose interest because of the inadequacy of these learning systems:
- E.g., the use of only text-based material;
    - Discussion: How can this be improved in terms of interactivity? What other factors impact students negatively besides lack of interactivity and interest?
        - Studies can be conducted on social media that deal with the sentiment analysis of users and what their are complaining about.
            - E.g., the use of jargon; long paragraphs etc.
    - Improvement can be offer interactive tools, such as "comment everywhere" systems.
    - What can be done to improve good understanding of text-based learning resources? Graphs? Illustrations?
    - How can we mimic the real conversations that occur in traditional classrooms?
- The use of sound, text, image, and video affect learner-content interactivity and may negatively affect learning, especially when presenting instructional content.
    - Discussion: How about improving knowledge structure through concept graphs
    - Discussion: How to improve the overall learning process; What is the learning process like?
    - In the paper, hints of immediate question and answering systems are highlighted and proposed, specifically as it relates to instructional videos
        - This is observed as a disadvantage when compared to conventional classroom environments in which question can be addressed immediately.
    - Pay close attention to the problem of "passive" learning vs "active" learning

Discussion: How to effectively synthesize multimedia content?
  - To answer this question we need to understand the impact of different factors as it relates to e-learning effectiveness
      - Some factors may be discovered using big data analytics on forums where dialogue occurs

Factors on which the proposed system focuses:
- Multimedia integration
- Immediate knowledge acquisition
- Interactivity (e.g., real-time Q/A)
- Self-directivity - personalized, self-paced learning
- Flexibility and Intelligence (track learning patterns and progress, then provides personalized lecturing)      

Constructive Learning Theory suggests that everyone has their own learning patterns or prefer to learn in their own way.

The Learning By Asking (LBA) system allows learners to ask questions to other learners via well-composed questions or through simple keywords
- An assistant built into the LBA is also able to answer questions and provide quick guides and suggestions based on user history
- The LBA system provide all sort of controls for user to maneuver around the system easily, offering the necessary flexibility required by learners.
- The LBA system also provide the traditional commenting features
- Discussion: How can chat or conversational bots be used to improve such systems.

Based on the experiments conducted:
- Students in the e-learning setting performed far better than the students in the traditional classroom environment
- The level of satisfaction wasn't significant
- Through questionnaires, student reported that they enjoyed the self-paced learning

Discussion: Perhaps we can learn from e-learning environments to improve traditional classrooms learning as well.
- For instance, observe how students ask questions; are there any patterns as to the time the questions are asked? and what kind of question are asked; and when.

E-learning requires more maturity and self-discipline
- What can be done about this fact in order to improve the learning experience for different type of students?
- What can be done to improve motivation?
- What can be done to lower the high number of dropouts?
- What can be done about the logistical concerns?

Other issues to pay attention to in the e-learning environment:
- Trust, Authorization, Confidentiality, Responsibility
- Security
- The need for high-bandwidth access

E-learning can also be seen as a compliment to traditional classroom learning instead of a complete replacement.
- This can be done by integrating appropriate pedagogical methods to interactive systems.

### [e-Learning Is the the "e" or the learning that matters?]()
Companies are using e-learning systems as differentiators and capital through relying on the rapid absorbing of information

The focus should be more on the learning rather than the actual e-learning platforms. As it was found that there is already many e-learning solutions but not so much relevant and useful content for learning.

Elements of e-learning content
- **Information architecture** - it is considered as the process of translating user requirements into function definitions while at the same time being aware of information overload and the many issues faced with content delivery.

- **User interface design** and cognitive processes involved in learning - UI facilitates learning through ease of learning, efficiency of use, memorability, error frequency, and subjective satisfaction.

- **Content strategy** - attention must be given to how content is organized. The idea is to organize the content in a way that is pleasing for the user consuming the type of content being put out by the e-learning platform. (e.g., lists and pyramids are effective strategies)

- **Pedagogical dimensions** for quality e-learning experiences
  - **Constructivist approach** - all new knowledge is based on the foundation of prior knowledge. Attention to information delivery strategies must be considered to achieve effective learning experiences for users. In other words, the user must have access to additional knowledge or information on demand, instead of the user having to search for this information, which can lead to confusion and lack of interest in the content being provided, due to lack of organization and friendliness, usefulness, and resourcefulness.
    - Discussion - How to achieve this in text-based medium where content is mostly static and the functions available are limited.
  - **Self-directed learning** - students must be given useful guides that warrant continuous learning and allows them to achieve their learning goals and the same time allows them to self-assess their knowledge.
    - Discussion - For text-based learning content it is important to link to relevant links that allows the learning experience to continue rather than stagnate the learning journey. **Course structure** map or syllabus are useful for these type of issues. E.g., relevant exercises can be provided to allows users to self-assess their progress in learning. It is also important that learners are made aware of what competencies are being acquired if those exercises are successfully completed.
  - **Evoke intrinsic motivation** - Where emotions and learning are concerned, learners must be kept in positive emotive states for them to feel motivated while learning.
    - Negative tensions can come about through some required skills or some other factors. These can be minimized through the offering of support features such as chats, etc.
  - **Reflective approach** - access to learning material at any time
  - **Individual learning styles** - e-learning systems must offer maximum flexibility to satisfy all different types of learners. From the fast learners to the slow learners.
  - **Experiential learning** - at the end of the say the system is measured how effective it is not by design elements but by how actionable the knowledge is that is being learned.
  - **Learning both a private and social activity** - Feature to achieve both social and private learning must be taken into account
  - **Learning is not linear** - learning in a spiraling manner so as to learn topics at a deep and detailed level.
    - Discussion: In text-based material, what kind of techniques can be used to support this type of non-linear learning?
- In conclusion the "e" in e-learning should be redefined to include "experience", "engagement", and other high level contexts.
