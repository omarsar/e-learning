### Theory Supporting Design Guidelines for Web-based Instruction
Besides having the advantage provided by asynchronous and synchronous communication, learning can be enhanced through how the learning material is presented and how the students interpret the material. There are many theories which can be adopted to enhance learning.
  - **Gestalt theory** - explore perception and its relationship to learning
  - **The Laws of Perception** in web-based intructional learning:
    - Contrast
    - Simplicity
    - Proximity
    - Similarity
    - Symmetry
    - Closure
  - **Cognitive Theory** - can be used to design a different and effective learning experience, in terms of student's interactions.
    - Cognitive mapping
    - Webbing
    - Concept attainment activities
    - Motivation graphics
    - Animation and sounds
  - **Constructivism** - require active and engaging tasks that require more than minimal intellectual involvement
    - Model creation of what was learned
    - Methapor creation of what was learned
    - Observation and explanation of simulations
    - Individual and group online problem solving

#### Gestalt Theory
**Figure-ground** - contrast between foreground and background must be distinct enough to highlight the information being presented

Individual use **prior knowledge** to learn so when presented with sophisticated and strange visual, they become perplexed and this hinders the learning process.
  - From simplified graphics to gradually more complex graphics can be used to avoid misinterpretation of visuals

**Proximity** of content is important to avoid confusion

**Laws of Similarity**, through differentation techniques, helps in highlighting specific components of a graph or text.
  - Should only be used to emphasize key words and key aspects of graphic

**Law of Closure** - when students try to use prior knowledge to fill in missing information
  - Usually leads to misinterpretation of information because student will turn to meaning-making
  - Usually slows down the learning process

**Gestalt Theory Guidelines (Summary):**
  - Background and Foreground must not interfere with each other
  - Simplified graphics; add complexity gradually if necessary
  - Place related information together
  - Differentiation techniques, such as color, animation, flashing can be used to draw attention to key text or graphic components
  - Avoid using time to make meaning, instead use visual and textual information to achieve meaning-making
  - Avoid jargons; common terms should be used instead

#### Cognitive Mapping
**Cognitive Mapping information:**
  - Types - webs, graphic organizers, and outlines are forms of cognitive mapping
  - Are more effective when used at the beginning of web-based lessons (Taba, 1962)
  - *Visual referents* or **Text Outlines** can be used to summarize the relationship between the elements of the content (Reibar, 1994)
  - Categorization enables learners to remember and learning information effectively
  - **Relevant anectodes** and **anologies** are useful to active previous knowledge and help student grasp and learn new information in a more meaningful and easier way.
    - **Questioning** during presentations are good to activate previous knowledge as well. In addition, responses and body language in students must be observed.
  - Students learn more when information being presented is meaningful to them, and they are able to make meaningful interpretations
    - **Discussion:** How to achieve this in text-based instructional lessons?
  - Methods to activate **prior knowledge**:
     - Short Q/A
     - Post questions in chat room
     - Exclusive **advance organizers** help to overview a new topic (sound file or text on screen) - (Ausubel et al 1978, Zook 1991)
  - Motivation in learning can be achieved through interactive and dynamic content like sounds

**Guidelines for Cognitive Theory**
  - Start lesson with cognitive maps, Webs, outltines, or list of objectives
  - When appropriate use a concept development activity
  - Strategize for activities that activate prior knowledge
  - Use motivational graphics; e.g., cute, funny, relevant pictures

#### Constructivist Theory
Another theoretical base to design web-based instructions for learning.
  - **Learner construction of meaning**
  - **social interaction for learning**
  - **real-world problem solving**
    - Try to solve authentic problems in the real world; e.g., data scientist students can participate in Kaggle competitions
    - Simulations:
      - Let sudents observe unfamiliar events and report on their understanding given some instructions (structuring of knowledge activity). Even a simple video would do.
      - Let students participate in actual roles for real-world problem solving
      - Involved students in research assignments where they research and use databases to construct knowledge; give it as a group assignment as well and use chat rooms to further discussions on experiences obtained and strategies used to construct knowledge. Sharing is also important in learning.

This theory also involves the use of prior knowledge to make meaning.

Allows students to participate in conceptualization activities by allowing to create outlines and other activities that involved organizing concepts.

Students also learn through the communication they have with their peers, therefore social interaction is important for learning. Achieved through:
  - chat rooms
  - emails
  - communication tools
  - threaded discussions
    - **Discussion** How to achieve this in the text-based learning material? Chat / Comment everywhere features?

Discussions on the web must be guided in a way such that the students participate in deeper discussions. Instructors are usually responsible for this or teaching assistants.

**Guidelines for Constructivist Theory**
  - Activities for constructing meaning from information - outlines, graphics, etc.
  - Activities that promote social interaction and communication among students.
    - Depth of dicussion should be encouraged
    - Summarized notes is a proper activity for students; minimal guidance should be provides before hand on what is expected; feedback is also important to encourage deep conversations instead of just superficial thinking.
  - Activites to engage students in authentic problem-solving
    - simulations; proper guidance or scaffolding needs to be provided in some cases.

### Theoretical and Practical Considerations in the Design of Web-based Instruction
Topics covered in the chapter:
  - Instructional web features relating to structure, media, and communication capabilities
  - Epistemology and cognitive learning theories
  - Web Design factors: theoretical orientation, learning goals, content, learner characteristics, and technological capabilities.
  - Issues for web designers
  - Factors that affect web-based instruction: efficacy studies, technological advances, pressures of competition and cost containment, and professional responses to market influences.

**Instructional web features relating to:**
- Structure
  - Web is non-linear, hierarchical, and associative, possessing a similarity to how cognitive models of memory are structured
  - Learning involves the reorganization of cognitive structure (schemata)
- Media
  - Types: illustrations, pictures, animation, video, and sound (hypermedia)
  - Important for the learning experience
- Communication capabilities
  - Computer mediated communication with different modalities (1 to 1, 1 to many, many to many)

**Epistemology and cognitive learning theories**
Epistemology is concerned with the nature of knowledge, and thus with questions of reality and truth.

  - The **objectivist paradigm** posits knowledge as separate from and external to the knower.
    - Objects and events have inherent meaning whether or note an individual has awareness of them.
    - Here instructions must be symbolically represented as external knowledge so that learners can accurately acquire its meaning.
      - This avoid perception bias or cognitive bias which is invevitable in humans.

  - **Constructivism:**
    - Knowledge is a subjective construction
    - Reality and truth are relative (constructed) and not absolute (objective)
    - Consensus achieved by interal congurence of understanding or through social negotiation with others.

  - **Epistemology and Technology**
    - Epistemology informs learning and instruction theories that, in turn, suggest applications of Web technologies.
    - To teach effectively one must have good theory of learning, know definition of learning and beliefs about how learning takes place
      - One must also understand that learning presupposes a philosophical position.
    - *Information processing theory* are associated with presentation and representation
    - *Constructivist Theory* is associate with construction
  - **Epistemology and Practise**
    - There are two types of instructing strategies:
      - Atheoretical - ad-hoc approaches
      - Theoretical (recommended approach) - knowledge represented through two learning theories: objectivist information processing theory versus constructivist learning approaches.
    - Choosing the strategy for teaching using Web-based technology must be grounded on both theories

**Factors that Influences the Design of Web-Based Instruction**
They are mainly:
  - **Theoretical orientation for Instruction**
    - Information Processing Theory ("mind as computer") - knowledge constucted already; focus on delivering
      - Posits that the mind consists of basic elements, such as structure and processes to acquire knowledge (objectivist viewpoint)
      - Important how learners encode, process, and retrieve information
      - Appropirately designed instructional strategies (analogies, hierarchy, prior knowledge) aid acquisition of knowledge.
      - Different levels of interactivity are required for memorization than for problem solving; involve different cognitive processes
    - Constructivism - requires knowing how leaners make meaning so as to promote knowledge construction
      - Doesn't require prescriptive presentation or accurate knowledge representation as in the objectivist approach
      - Require different strategies to construct or make meaning
        - Collaboration - promote conversation among learners to obtain knowledge
        - Diverse perspectives - tasks to create different views
        - Authentic context - knowledge only has meaning in context; involves coaching, modeling, and scaffolding

  - **Learning goals**
    - Objectivist - the learning goal is to acquire knowledge
    - Constructivist - the learning goal is to construct meaningful knowledge
  - **Content**
    - Choice of theory influences content to be presentented in instruction
    - Objectivist - from simple to complex concepts are presented
    - Constructivist - case studies or problem solving techniques are used for learning
  - **Learner characteristics** - When allows to surf the web freely, learners, especially novice ones, are not guaranteed to learn; the different categories are as follows:
    - Cognitive characteristics
    - Motivation
      - Interest in or attention to the information and the Technology  
      - perceived relevance of the information
      - successful access to and usefulness of the information
      - resulting satisfaction from successful access to and usefulness of the information
    - Knowledge
      - prior knowledge is important in hypertext media
    - Social context
  - Technological capabilities
